                        Our Mandate
                        The Department of Education was established through the Education Decree of 1863
                         as the Superior Commission of Primary Instruction under a Chairman. The Education agency underwent
                          many reorganization efforts in the 20th century in order to better define its purpose vis a vis the changing
                           administrations and charters. The present day Department of Education was eventually mandated through Republic Act 9155,
                            otherwise known as the Governance of Basic Education act of 2001 which establishes the mandate of this agency.

                              including alternative learning systems, both public and private; and provides for the establishment and maintenance of a complete,
